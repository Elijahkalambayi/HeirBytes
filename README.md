HeirBytes – MVP Concept Overview 
“Preserve your past, enrich your present, and inspire your future — one story at a time.” 
This document provides a clear, concise overview of the HeirBytes concept, intended to  guide developers in building the MVP. 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Problem Identified 
In a hyper-digital era, the stories, traditions, and values of past generations are being lost.  Many people from broken families, diasporas, or marginalized communities lack tools to  preserve their personal histories in a meaningful way. People are losing connection to their  roots. Traditional memory-keeping is passive, boring, or fragmented. Most “legacy”  platforms feel like cold data storage—missing the joy, emotion, and social energy that  storytelling is meant to evoke. 
Executive Summary 
HeirBytes is a warm, modern, emotionally intelligent, AI-enhanced digital platform that  helps families document, share, and preserve their legacy through voice, story, memory, and  multimedia. Its vision is to redefine how modern families and individuals—from all  backgrounds—preserve their roots, heal their narratives, and build a bridge between past,  present, and future. Unlike traditional genealogy apps, HeirBytes is built for fun, emotional  connection, and real-time interaction across generations — creating a digital legacy that  evolves. The MVP focuses on capturing personal and family stories through text, voice  notes, and guided prompts, while enabling families to connect privately in shared spaces.
